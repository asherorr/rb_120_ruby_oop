#In the first version of the code, the `success` variable points to a Ruby setter method, which always
#returns the argument passed in (a truthy value), even if an explicit return statement exists within the method body.

#For this reason, `success` on line 25 always evaluates to true. 

#However, when the `balance=` method is invoked on line 25, the argument passed in, `new_balance`, which in this case is -30, 
#will cause the `valid_transaction?` method in `balance=` to return false, which bypasses the reassignment of the @balance instance variable
#on line 39.

#I changed the code to check the validity of the transaction by calling `valiid_transaction?`
#in `withdraw` instead of `balance=`. This way, we don't attempt to use the setter for its return value, which results in a buggy program.
