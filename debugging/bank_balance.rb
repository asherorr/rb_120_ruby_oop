#In the first version of the code, the `BankAccount#withdraw` method contained a logical errror.
#The `success` variable was always returning true, because it was only checking if the 
#operation `self.balance -= amount` returned true, which it would even if the amount
#withdrawn was greater than the balance.

#I refactored this method to return true on line 92 only if the balance, minus the amount withdrawn
#is greater than 0.
#The code now works as expected.
